## 📝 Tips for Final Exam Preparation

1. **Utilize Tutorial Materials**  
   Make full use of your tutorial materials, as the final exam is often very similar to them. 📂

2. **Exam Difficulty**  
   The difficulty of the final exam depends on whether it is **open book** or **1 A4 cheatsheet**:  
   - 📖 **Open Book**: The exam will be more challenging.  
   - 📄 **1 A4 Cheatsheet**: Easier compared to open book exams.  
   - **Example**:  
     - AY2324's final was fully open book and harder.  
     - AY2425's final allows a single A4 cheatsheet and is relatively easier.

3. **CS2106 Reference**  
   After the midterm, the content of **CS2106** overlaps significantly with IT5002. You can refer to CS2106 resources available on **GitHub**. 🔗
